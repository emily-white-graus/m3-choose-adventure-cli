# Choose your own adventure cli - harry potter inspired ;P
An interactive Choose Your Own Adventure–style story built with TypeScript, Node.js, and @inquirer/prompts.

The story is fully defined in story.json, and the engine (in main.ts) loads scenes, displays text, and allows the player to choose their path.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the CLI in development mode

This runs the TypeScript file directly using ts-node:
```bash
npm run dev:cli
```
